## Key Themes Emerging from Analysis

1. **Diagnostic Delays and Bottlenecks**: Average 24-month diagnostic delay with patients seeing 6.1 physicians before diagnosis represents the single largest systemic failure
2. **Treatment Escalation Failures**: 75.6% of patients remain uncontrolled despite available treatments; ~4,000-5,000 patients who should be on biologics are not receiving them
3. **Primary Care Knowledge Gaps**: 58% of patients first diagnosed in primary care, but GPs have variable guideline awareness and tendency to overuse corticosteroids
4. **Regional Access Inequities**: 32% of patients wait >90 days for specialist care; northern/rural regions face significant barriers
5. **Mental Health Integration Gaps**: 37-48% of patients have psychiatric comorbidity but mental health services are rarely integrated into CSU care
6. **Missing Infrastructure**: No dedicated Swedish CSU registry, no UCARE-certified center, no CSU-specific patient organization
